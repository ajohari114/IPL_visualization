            Are you a cricket stats fnatic? Do you find yourself over IPL debates among your friends? How much time do you spend convincing your friend that Royal Challengers Bangalore
             ain't winning anything? (sorry)
                If you're a passionate cricket enthusiast, then this website is perfect for you!
            <br>
                These interactive visualizations provide valuable insights into long-time rivalries, team's consistency, and how much the location of a match can play a role in deciding the outcome of the game!

            <h4>
                Use this interactive visualization to explore the Head-to-Head between teams! The links between the teams are colored proportionally to show the win-rate ratio at a glance!
                For e.g. Sunrisers Hyderabad has never won against Lucknow Supergiants (unbelievable right?), so the entire line is black. If you need specific stats, hover over the links to get
                the exact stats!
